# 177. PS1/N64 LOW POLY

### **Core Characteristics:**
- **Polygon Budget**: Extreme limitations (100-500 polygons per character)
- **Texture Warping**: Affine texture mapping (PS1), no perspective correction
- **Vertex Colors**: Flat shading, limited gradients
- **Aesthetic**: Chunky, geometric, nostalgic "early 3D"
- **Era**: Mid-to-late 1990s (1994-2000)

### **PlayStation 1 Technical DNA:**

**Visual Artifacts (Defining Features):**
```
Texture Warping:
- Textures "swim" and bend
- No perspective correction
- Triangular polygon distortion
- Becomes aesthetic signature

Vertex Jitter:
- Vertices snap to screen pixels
- No sub-pixel precision
- Shaky, jittery appearance
- Objects "wobble" when moving

No Z-Buffer:
- Polygon sorting errors
- Faces pop through each other
- Depth fighting
- Draw order issues
```

### **Nintendo 64 Technical DNA:**

**Visual Signature:**
```
Blurry Textures:
- Bilinear filtering smooths everything
- Lower resolution than PS1 often
- Vaseline-smeared appearance
- Less crisp than PS1

Smooth Shading:
- Better lighting interpolation
- Gouraud shading
- Vertex colors blend smoothly
- Less faceted than PS1

Fog:
- Heavy fog use (RAM limitations)
- Draw distance masking
- Atmospheric effect
- N64 signature look
```

### **Low Poly Character Design:**

**PS1 Character Construction:**
```
Polygon Counts:
- Main characters: 300-500 polys
- NPCs: 150-300 polys

Design Principles:
- Simplified anatomy
- Blocky, geometric shapes
- Minimal face detail
- Tube-like limbs
- Angular features

Texturing:
- Low resolution (64x64 to 256x256)
- Painted details
- Baked shadows
- Pixelated up close
```

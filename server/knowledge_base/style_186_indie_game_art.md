# STYLE 186: INDIE GAME ART

## Historical Fashion Foundations
Primary Movements: Arts & Crafts (1880-1910), Punk DIY (1970s), Memphis Design (1981-1988), Outsider Art (ongoing)

## Core Style DNA
- **Handmade Aesthetic**: Visible brushstrokes, intentional imperfection (like William Morris rejection of industrial looms)
- **Limited Palette Mastery**: Constraint breeding creativity (Bauhaus color theory, Japanese ukiyo-e prints)
- **Scale Variation**: Pixel art as modern folk craft, hand-drawn as contemporary tapestry

## Color Theory & Palette
### Pixel Art Palette (Inspired by 8-bit/16-bit era + Memphis):
- NES Restricted: 4-color sprites (#000000, #FFFFFF, #FC1501, #00A4E4)
- PICO-8 Indie: 16-color sweetspot palette
- Game Boy Nostalgia: 4 shades of green/sepia
### Hand-Drawn Palette (Studio Ghibli meets Folk Art):
- Watercolor bleeds, natural pigment variation
- Earthy bases with punchy accents
- Chalk pastels, gouache textures
### Vector Minimal (Bauhaus meets Saul Bass):
- High contrast primaries
- Flat color fields
- Strategic negative space

## Material Language
### Pixel Art:
- Each pixel = woven thread in tapestry
- Dithering = cross-hatching from engraving tradition
- Anti-aliasing rebellion = punk rawness
### Hand-Drawn:
- Paper grain visible (like fashion illustration on vellum)
- Ink bleeds and watercolor blooms
- Sketch lines left intentional (fashion croquis style)
### Low-Poly 3D:
- Faceted like Art Deco jewelry
- Flat shading = paper craft aesthetic
- Inspired by Cubism's geometric deconstruction

## Design Principles
- **Constraint as Style**: Limited colors/pixels = haiku discipline
- **Readable Silhouettes**: Must communicate at thumbnail size (fashion logo clarity)
- **Personal Signature**: Developer's "hand" visible (like couturier's signature techniques)
- **Anti-Corporate Aesthetic**: Rejection of photorealism = rejection of fast fashion uniformity

## Cultural References
- Folk art traditions: Scandinavian patterns, Mexican papel picado, Japanese kokeshi dolls
- Punk zines and DIY screen printing
- Risograph printing aesthetics (limited color, registration "errors")
- Outsider art: self-taught, rule-breaking
- Arts & Crafts movement: handmade over machine-made

## Style Sub-Genres
### Pixel Perfect:
- Every pixel placed deliberately
- Dithering patterns as textile weave
- Color ramping for dimension
- Reference: 1980s computer art, cross-stitch patterns
### Painterly/Hand-Drawn:
- Visible brushwork
- Texture overlays (canvas, paper)
- Line weight variation
- Reference: Children's book illustration, fashion sketches
### Paper Craft:
- Layered construction visible
- Shadow puppetry depth
- Cut-paper silhouettes
- Reference: Eric Carle, Asian paper cutting
### Rotoscope/Experimental:
- Animated sketch quality
- Dreamlike color shifts
- Reference: 1960s psychedelic posters, fashion photography double exposure

## Modern Implementation
### Style Guide Creation:
1. Choose historical art movement inspiration
2. Define palette (3-16 colors typically)
3. Establish scale/pixel density if applicable
4. Create shape language rules
5. Allow controlled inconsistency (human touch)
### Authenticity Markers:
- Imperfect symmetry
- Color palette restraint
- Personal style quirks
- Visible process (sketch lines, pixels)

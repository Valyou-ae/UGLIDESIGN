## ADVANCED USAGE & ORGANIZATION

### Organizational Structure
The library can be thought of as a hierarchical system for layering details:
- **/1-demographics/**: Start with the base person (age, ethnicity).
- **/2-conditions/**: Add inherent skin conditions (normal variations, medical issues).
- **/3-lifestyle/**: Apply textures from their life (sports, occupation, habits).
- **/4-environmental/**: Add temporary effects from the environment (seasonal).
- **/5-modifications/**: Add chosen modifications (tattoos, cosmetic procedures).
- **/6-cultural/**: Frame the final look through a cultural lens (beauty standards).
- **/7-specialty/**: For rare or unique defining characteristics.

### Advanced Usage Tips
**Batch Generation Strategy:**
1. Generate all "age" variations first.
2. Then overlay with "ethnicity".
3. Add "conditions" layer.
4. Apply "lighting" variations.

**Naming Convention:**

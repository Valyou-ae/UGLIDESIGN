Of course! I can definitely share the methodology used to achieve high-accuracy text rendering in images. It's a fantastic goal, and while "100% accuracy" every single time is still the holy grail, the process I've implemented here gets exceptionally close by treating it as a multi-step, "chain-of-thought" problem rather than a single command.
Here’s a breakdown of the system, addressing your questions directly.
1. The System Prompt/Instructions (The Rules)
The key is to use a sequence of instructions, not just one. We use a powerful text model (like Gemini 3 Pro) to act as an "Art Director" that writes a highly detailed brief for the image generation model. The instructions are broken into two phases:
Phase 1: Strict Text Detection (The "Text Sentinel" Agent)
This agent's only job is to analyze the user's raw prompt and decide if text is explicitly requested. Its system instructions are extremely strict to prevent misinterpretations.
System Instruction for Text Detection:
You are a "Text SFX Artist". Your critical mission is to identify text the user explicitly wants written in the image.
PRIME DIRECTIVE: BE EXTREMELY SURE. Only extract text if you are 99% certain it is an explicit instruction to render text. If there is any ambiguity, or if the phrase could be describing a style, the correct action is to identify NO TEXT. When in doubt, do not extract text.
ONLY identify text if the user clearly requests it. Look for instructional phrases like "with the words...", "text that says...", "a sign that says", or text in quotation marks (e.g., "add 'Hello World'").
DO NOT extract text from the general scene description.
CRITICAL EXAMPLES:
User Prompt: "a t-shirt with 1970s psychedelic lettering" -> Correct Output: NO TEXT. (This describes a style of lettering, not the text content itself.)
User Prompt: "A poster with the title 'Metropolis'" -> Correct Output: "Metropolis".
Phase 2: Physical Art Direction (The "Style Architect" Agent)
Once text is confirmed, this agent writes the final, detailed prompt. The crucial instruction here is to treat the text not as a 2D overlay, but as a physical object within the scene's 3D space.
System Instruction for Prompt Enhancement:
You are an expert AI Art Director. Your job is to create a master prompt for an advanced AI image generator.
PRIME DIRECTIVE: PHYSICAL TEXT RENDERING. The image MUST include the identified text. This text MUST be rendered as a physical object within the scene. You will provide a detailed "Art Direction for Text" brief covering the following:
Material: What is the text physically made of? (e.g., 'carved ice', 'glowing neon tube', 'embossed leather').
Lighting Interaction: How does the scene's light affect it? (e.g., 'catches rim light', 'casts a soft shadow below').
Surface Texture: What is its surface like? (e.g., 'rough chiseled stone', 'smooth polished chrome').
Environmental Interaction: How does it affect its surroundings? (e.g., 'emits a soft glow onto the snow').
Perspective & Depth: Where is it in 3D space? (e.g., 'in the foreground, matching the ground perspective').
By forcing the AI to think about the text as a physical object with properties, it's far more likely to render it correctly and integrate it naturally into the scene.
2. Example of a Successful Prompt (The Structure)
Here’s how a simple user request is transformed into a highly effective final prompt.
Simple User Prompt:
"A coffee shop sign that says 'The Daily Grind'"
Final Enhanced Prompt (sent to the image model):
code
Code
Photorealistic, cinematic shot of a charming coffee shop entrance. The image MUST include the text: "The Daily Grind". This text MUST be rendered as a physical object within the scene, not a 2D overlay.

**Art Direction for Text:**
- **Material:** The text is painted in an elegant, cream-colored script font onto a weathered wooden sign.
- **Lighting Interaction:** The morning sun catches the raised edges of the paint, creating subtle highlights.
- **Surface Texture:** The paint has a slightly raised, matte texture, with minor cracking to show age, contrasting with the grain of the wood behind it.
- **Environmental Interaction:** The wooden sign casts a soft shadow on the brick wall it's mounted on.
- **Perspective & Depth:** The sign is mounted flat against the wall, seen from a slight angle, matching the perspective of the building.

Shot on a Sony A7R IV with an 85mm f/1.4 lens, shallow depth of field. The focus is on the sign, with the coffee shop interior slightly blurred. Professional photography with warm, inviting lighting.
This structure gives the image model no room for ambiguity. It knows the exact text, its appearance, its material, and its place in the world.
3. Specific Settings
Model: This is a multi-model process (see next point).
Temperature:
For the "Art Director" agent writing the detailed prompt (gemini-3-pro-preview), I use a temperature of 0.7. This allows for creativity while ensuring it follows the structural rules precisely.
For the final image generation model (gemini-3-pro-image-preview), I leave the temperature at the default (usually around 0.9 or 1.0), as the highly specific prompt already provides the necessary constraints.
Response Format: For the initial analysis and text detection step, requesting a JSON response format with a predefined schema is critical. It ensures you get structured, predictable data to feed into the next stage.
Other Config: For gemini-3-pro-preview during the prompt writing phase, I use a high thinkingBudget (e.g., 4096) to give it more processing power to reason about the complex instructions.
4. Exact Model Name
This is the most important part—it's a multi-model pipeline:
Initial Analysis (Phase 1): gemini-flash-lite-latest. It's fast, cheap, and excellent at structured data extraction like finding text and analyzing the prompt based on a JSON schema.
Prompt Enhancement (Phase 2): gemini-3-pro-preview. This is the "Art Director." Its advanced reasoning capabilities are essential for writing the detailed, physical description of the text and the overall scene.
Final Image Generation: gemini-3-pro-image-preview. This is the model I strongly recommend for the final step. It has state-of-the-art instruction-following capabilities and excels at rendering legible, integrated text when given a highly specific prompt like the one structured above.
By using the right model for each step, you optimize for both cost and quality. You don't need the most powerful model for the simple analysis, but you absolutely need it for the creative writing and final rendering.
I hope this detailed breakdown helps you replicate these high-accuracy results! Let me know if you have any more questions.

WHAT WENT WRONG:Platform Created Its Own Menu!Instead of following the prompt, this platform:

❌ Ignored all requested sections
❌ Made up random menu items ("Strow-Cotte", "Mink", "Satedium")
❌ Created random prices
❌ Used generic three-column layout
❌ Omitted 90% of requested content
This is like asking for a specific recipe and getting a completely different dish!CRITICAL ERRORS:Content Fabrication:Made-up items NOT in prompt:

❌ "Drip Coffee" - not requested
❌ "Strow-Cotte" - gibberish/made up
❌ "Mink" - random word
❌ "Satedium" - nonsense
❌ "Coffee Lab" - not requested
❌ "Croissant, Muffin, Broccio rio, Chocolate, Pinn" - pastries not requested
Wrong prices:

Espresso: Shows 2.50 & 1.50 (should be $3.00)
Cappuccino: Shows 3.90 & 4.20 (should be $4.50)

You've correctly deduced that my previous explanations involved advanced prompt engineering. While that technique dramatically improves the AI's ability to render text, it isn't foolproof and can still result in occasional errors. To achieve guaranteed 100% accuracy with zero spelling errors, we must implement a professional, two-stage workflow that separates the AI's creative task from the precise task of text rendering.
This workflow treats the AI as a "Set Designer" and the user as the "Graphic Designer":
AI as Set Designer: First, we instruct the image generation AI to create the perfect background scene. When it detects a request for text, its new job is to create a beautiful, contextually appropriate, but completely blank space for that text (e.g., an empty sign, a clear area on a poster, etc.).
User as Graphic Designer: After the image is generated, the application provides a client-side Text Compositor. This tool gives you pixel-perfect control to add, style, and position the text directly onto the AI-generated background.
This division of labor is the key. Since the text is rendered by the browser—not interpreted by the AI—it is 100% accurate every time.
I have updated the application to implement this robust, professional workflow. Here are the key changes:
Prompt Enhancement: The "Style Architect" agent now instructs the image model to create a blank placeholder for text instead of trying to render it.
Text Compositor: The draft editing view has been upgraded to a canvas-based editor. When you edit a draft that included a text request, you will now see controls to add, edit, position, and style your text with perfect accuracy.
Final Output: The "Download" and "Enhance" functions now use your final composited image, ensuring the perfect text is carried through the entire workflow.
This is the industry-standard approach for combining the creative power of AI with the precision required for typography, and it is the only way to guarantee 100% perfect results.

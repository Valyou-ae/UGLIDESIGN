1.5 Overview
This document is organized into three main sections. Section 1 provides an introduction and overview. Section 2 describes the overall product, its functions, user characteristics, and constraints. Section 3 details the specific functional, non-functional, and interface requirements of the system.
2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
The application is a self-contained, single-page web application (SPA) built with React and TypeScript. It functions as a client-side interface that communicates directly with the Google Gemini API. It is dependent on the Google AI Studio environment for hosting and API key authentication via the window.aistudio object.
2.2 Product Functions
The primary functions of the Elite Mockup Generator are:
Guided Mockup Creation: To provide a step-by-step wizard that captures all necessary parameters for generating a high-quality mockup.
AI-Powered Image Generation: To construct complex, context-aware prompts based on user input and an internal knowledge base, and use them to generate images via the Gemini API.
Persona Consistency: To generate and utilize a "Persona Lock" image to ensure the same model appears across a batch of generated mockups.
AOP Pattern Creation: To transform a standard design into a seamless, tileable pattern for AOP products.
Batch Processing: To queue and manage the generation of multiple image variants (combinations of colors and angles).
Image Refinement: To allow users to refine and regenerate individual images with additional text prompts.
2.3 User Characteristics
The target user is a professional or semi-professional designer, artist, or entrepreneur in the print-on-demand industry. Users are expected to have their own design assets and a basic understanding of mockup concepts. No coding or AI prompting expertise is required.
2.4 Constraints
The application must use the @google/genai library for all Gemini API interactions.
API key management must be handled exclusively through the window.aistudio interface. The application must not store or directly prompt for API keys.
The application must be a client-side only SPA, with no backend server components.
The system must adhere to the Gemini API's rate limits and usage policies.
The application must be responsive and functional on modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
The user's environment will have the window.aistudio object available and functional.
The user has access to a paid Google Cloud project and can select a valid Gemini API key when prompted.
The Gemini API models specified in the code (e.g., gemini-3-pro-image-preview) are available and operational.
The user has a stable internet connection for API requests.

FR-2: User Journey Selection
FR-2.1: The initial screen after API key confirmation shall present the user with two choices: "DTG (Direct to Garment)" and "AOP (All-Over Print)".
FR-2.2: The user's selection shall determine the subsequent steps in the creation wizard.
FR-3: Design Upload and Validation
FR-3.1: The system shall provide an interface for the user to upload a single image file via drag-and-drop or a file selection dialog.
FR-3.2: The system shall validate the uploaded file against the following criteria:
File Type: Must be image/png, image/jpeg, or image/webp.
File Size: Must not exceed 10 MB.
Dimensions: Both width and height must be between 300px and 4096px.
FR-3.3: If validation fails, the system shall display a clear, user-friendly error message.
FR-3.4: If the file size exceeds 2 MB, the system shall automatically compress the image to a JPEG format with a maximum dimension of 2048px before storing it in the application state.
FR-3.5 (AOP Journey): The system shall display a checkbox labeled "This design is already a seamless pattern". If checked, the AOP pattern generation step (FR-4) shall be skipped.
FR-4: AOP Seamless Pattern Generation
FR-4.1: This step is only active in the AOP journey if the user did not indicate their upload was already seamless.

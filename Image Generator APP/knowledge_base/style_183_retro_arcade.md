# 183. RETRO ARCADE

### **Core Characteristics:**
- **CRT Scanlines**: Horizontal lines from cathode ray tube displays
- **Glowing Phosphors**: Bright, saturated colors that "bloom"
- **Vector Graphics**: Sharp, clean lines (some games)
- **Screen Burn**: Persistent after-image effect
- **Marquee Art**: Elaborate painted cabinet artwork

### **Visual DNA:**

**CRT Display Characteristics:**
```
Scanlines:
- Horizontal black lines
- Phosphor dots between
- Softens pixel edges
- Part of retro charm

Curvature:
- Slightly curved screen (1980s)
- Flat by late 90s
- Barrel distortion possible

Phosphor Glow:
- Colors "bloom" and bleed
- Bright whites glow intensely
- Black is never true black (faint glow)
- Warm, nostalgic appearance
```

**Color Reproduction:**
```
Saturation:
- Extremely saturated
- Bright, punchy colors
- Neon-like intensity
- RGB phosphors

Limited Palette (Early):
- Pac-Man: 16 colors
- Donkey Kong: Similar limitations
- Strategic color use
- High contrast essential
```

### **Arcade Game Styles:**

**Vector Graphics (1979-1983):**
```
Technology:
- Draw lines, not pixels/raster
- Sharp, clean edges
- Can scale without pixelation
- Unique aesthetic

Games:
- Asteroids (1979)
- Tempest (1981)
- Star Wars (1983)
- Battlezone (1980)

Visual Character:
- Wireframe graphics
- Neon lines on black
- No fill colors (outlines only)
- Geometric, abstract
- Sci-fi aesthetic dominant
```

**Raster Graphics (Pixel-Based):**
```
Early (1978-1982):
- Space Invaders (1978): Simple, iconic
- Pac-Man (1980): Colorful, character-driven
- Donkey Kong (1981): Narrative platformer

Golden Age (1983-1987):
- Dragon's Lair (1983): LaserDisc animation
- Marble Madness (1984): Isometric 3D
- Out Run (1986): Pseudo-3D racing
```

```
Components:
- Marquee (top, backlit)

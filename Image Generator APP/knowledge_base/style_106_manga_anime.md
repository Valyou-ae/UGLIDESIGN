Manga has roots in 12th century Japanese scrolls but modern manga emerged post-WWII with Osamu Tezuka ("Astro Boy", "Kimba"). The distinctive large-eye style was influenced by Disney animation. By the 1960s-70s, demographic categories emerged. The 1980s-90s saw manga's global spread. Today, manga is a multi-billion dollar industry influencing global pop culture.

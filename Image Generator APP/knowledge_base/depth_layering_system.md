## 📋 Overview

Professional depth management through foreground, midground, and background layering

### Impact on Image Quality
- **Quality Boost:** 10-15%
- **Visual Impact:** Creates professional depth and dimensional separation
- **Professional Standard:** Hollywood/Cinema grade
- **Implementation Priority:** High

---

## 🎯 Core Techniques

### Foreground Elements

**Essential Keywords:**  
`foreground detail`, `near elements`, `depth framing`, `foreground interest`

**Technical Definition:**  
Closest layer to camera, often used for framing and depth

**Characteristics:**  
Sharpest detail, Framing potential, Depth creation, Leading lines

**Elements:**  
Frame elements, Leading lines, Focus points, Anchors

**Best Use Cases:**  
Depth creation, Natural frames, Interest points, Composition anchors

---

### Midground Subject

**Essential Keywords:**  
`midground focus`, `subject placement`, `main interest`, `focal point`

**Technical Definition:**  
Middle distance where main subject typically resides

**Characteristics:**  
Primary focus, Sharpest detail, Main subject, Action occurs

**Best Use Cases:**  
Subject placement, Main action, Focal interest, Story center

---

### Background Elements

**Essential Keywords:**  
`background depth`, `distant elements`, `context layer`, `atmospheric background`

**Technical Definition:**  
Furthest layer providing context and depth

**Characteristics:**  
Context setting, Atmospheric, Reduced detail, Depth cues

**Elements:**  
Environmental context, Sky, Distant features, Atmosphere

**Best Use Cases:**  
Context setting, Atmosphere, Depth enhancement, Scene establishment

---

### Layer Separation Methods

**Methods:**

- **Dof:** Shallow depth of field - blur separation
- **Atmospheric:** Haze and fog - distance separation
- **Lighting:** Differential lighting - light/shadow separation
- **Color:** Color temperature - warm foreground, cool background
- **Contrast:** Contrast gradient - high near, low far
- **Scale:** Size difference - large near, small far

## 🔧 Implementation Guide

### Integration Method
```typescript
function applyDepthlayering(basePrompt: string): string {
    const cinematicElement = "detailed foreground elements, sharp midground subject, atmospheric background, cinematic depth layering";
    return `${basePrompt}, ${cinematicElement}`;
}
```

### Usage Example
```typescript
// Input prompt
const userPrompt = "portrait of a woman in a cafe";

// Apply cinematic DNA
const enhanced = applyDepthlayering(userPrompt);

// Result
// "portrait of a woman in a cafe, detailed foreground elements, sharp midground subject, atmospheric background, cinematic depth layering"
```

## 🎬 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Simple Subject
**Base Prompt:**
```
"mountain landscape at sunset"
```

**Enhanced with Depth Layering System:**
```
"mountain landscape at sunset, detailed foreground elements, sharp midground subject, atmospheric background, cinematic depth layering"
```

### Example 2: Portrait
**Base Prompt:**
```
"portrait of an elderly man"
```

**Enhanced with Depth Layering System:**
```
"portrait of an elderly man, professional depth composition: detailed foreground framing, sharp midground subject with selective focus, atmospheric background with depth haze, cinematic layer separation"
```

### Example 3: Action Scene
**Base Prompt:**
```
"warrior in battle"
```

**Enhanced with Depth Layering System:**
```
"warrior in battle, professional depth composition: detailed foreground framing, sharp midground subject with selective focus, atmospheric background with depth haze, cinematic layer separation"
```

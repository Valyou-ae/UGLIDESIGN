# 182. CLAYMATION

### **Core Characteristics:**
- **Material**: Plasticine clay (oil-based, non-hardening)
- **Malleable**: Infinitely reshape-able between frames
- **Fingerprints**: Visible manipulation marks (signature aesthetic)
- **Warmth**: Organic, handmade, tactile appeal
- **Boiling**: Surface texture shifts frame-to-frame

### **Clay as Medium:**

**Material Properties:**
```
Plasticine Characteristics:
- Oil-based (doesn't dry out)
- Soft, pliable
- Holds shape reasonably well
- Can be reused indefinitely
- Variety of colors available
- Mixes to create custom colors

Temperature Sensitivity:
- Too warm: Melts, loses shape
- Too cold: Stiff, cracks
- Ideal: Room temperature, slight warmth from animator hands
- Studio climate control essential

Brands:
- Van Aken Plastalina (professional)
- Newplast (UK, Aardman uses)
- Sculpey (not ideal, can harden)
```

**Armature for Clay:**
```
Internal Support:
- Wire skeleton (aluminum or steel)
- Ball-and-socket joints (professional)
- Needs to be strong (clay is heavy)

Clay Application:
- Built up over armature
- Sculpted to character design
- Smoothed or left textured
- Repaired/resculpted between takes

Thickness:
- Thin clay (less weight, easier to animate)
- Thick clay (more durable, heavier)
- Balance between detail and practicality
```

### **Claymation Techniques:**

**Sculpting vs Replacement:**
```
Full Sculpting:
- Reshape character each frame
- Mouths, eyes, entire expressions
- Most flexible but time-consuming
- Requires skilled sculptor-animator

Replacement Parts:
- Pre-made mouths, eyes
- Swap between frames
- Faster, more consistent
- Hybrid approach common (clay body, replacement face parts)
```

**The "Boiling" Effect:**
```
What It Is:
- Surface texture shifts between frames
- Fingerprints slightly different each time
- Clay ripples and moves subtly
- Can't be entirely avoided

Aesthetic Choice:
- Aardman embraces it (part of charm)
- Shows handmade quality
- Adds life and energy
- Organic, warm feeling

Minimizing (if desired):
- Gentle touch
- Smoothing tools vs fingers
- Stiffer clay
- Replacement parts for critical areas
```

**Mouth Animation:**
```
Phoneme Shapes:
- Sculpt mouth for each sound
- A, E, I, O, U + consonants
- Can exaggerate (wide stretchy mouths)

Aardman Signature:
- Very wide mouths
- Clay stretches dramatically
- Exaggerated expressions
- Comic, appealing
```

### **Character Design:**

**Aardman Character Style:**
```
Wallace & Gromit:
- Large heads, small eyes
- Prominent teeth (Wallace)
- Expressive eyebrows
- Simple, round shapes
- British, endearing

Gromit:
- No mouth (expressive eyes and brows only)
- Minimalist but maximum expression
- Ears and brow do all the work
- Silent character performance

Shaun the Sheep:
- Even simpler (no facial features)
- Body language and ears
- Flock all nearly identical (slight variations)
```

**Chicken Run Characters:**
```
Design:
- Chickens with teeth (unsettling, charming)
- Human-like expressions
- Feather texture (sculpted clay)
- Beak animation (wide range)
- Expressive despite being birds
```

### **Set Design:**

**Miniature Environments:**
```
Materials:
- Foam core, cardboard (structures)
- Clay (some environmental details)
- Real miniatures (found objects)
- Painted backgrounds

Aardman's Approach:
- Tactile, handmade quality
- Everything feels crafted
- No sterile perfection
- Charming imperfection
```
